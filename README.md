## ðŸš€ Principal Cloud Architect | AWS | Azure | Automation | Security | Performance

### ðŸ“Œ About Me
With over a decade of experience in cloud architecture, automation, and security, I specialize in designing and scaling enterprise-grade AWS and Azure solutions. My expertise lies in building global landing zones, driving multi-cloud transformations, and optimising cloud environments for performance, security, and cost efficiency.

What I Do Best:
- Architecting and automating secure, scalable cloud infrastructures
- Leading cloud transformation initiatives for global enterprises
- Implementing cloud governance, security frameworks, and FinOps best practices
- Streamlining cloud operations with Terraform, AWS CDK, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Passionate about automation and security, I help organisations move beyond traditional IT bottlenecks by leveraging DevSecOps, zero-trust security models, and cloud-native architectures.

Future Vision:
As I continue to grow, Iâ€™m exploring opportunities to advise businesses as an independent cloud architect, helping them design resilient cloud strategies while minimising investment and risk.

Open to collaborations, thought leadership, and networkingâ€”letâ€™s connect and discuss how we can build the future of cloud together!
